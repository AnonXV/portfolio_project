            So, the homepage didn't explain enough for you?

            Fine, here's a bit more.

            <h2>About This Site</h2>
            <p>
                If you're reading this, you're either at my subpage on KA, or found my repo on GitHub. This site was me multi-tasking on both a school project and updating my subpage, so if something seems off it's probably because I forgot to change it from the other version.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Not much is known about me, but clearly I exist. Or, at least, something wants you to believe that I exist.

                I can do a few things here and there...
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>KAPJS (basically all I do on KA, along w. math)</li>
                <li>I guess I know some html now too, but this is my first webpage</li>
                <li>You know what, just check my projects, I'll let you decide</li>

            <h2>Project Highlights</h2>
            <p>
                These are a few of my projects that I decided to give more recognition.

                        <p>Literally just a cube made from vertices programmed in 250 characters. It doesn't look like much, but it took way longer than it should have to condense it so far.</p>

                        <p>This was the winner of the 50th KA Coding Contest. Unlike the cube above, which took me a couple of days, I spent a couple months on this one.</p>

                        <p>Another simple animation, I made this at a different school. I don't remember how long it took me to make this one, but if the first was days, the other months, I'll say this took weeks.</p>
