        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <br>
        <p>1. I don't collect your data because I don't know if KA even allows that.</p>
        <p>2. This site doesn't require signing-up or logging-in because this website is all about me. That would also be too much work.</p>
        <p>3. I am technically using some cookies, (the digital ones). They're just here doing stuff, and I don't really have anything to do with it.</p>
        <p>4. If you happen to accidentally get an email from me, that'll be really weird because neither of us knows the other's email.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In short: I just made this because that link on bottom looks nice, and I don't care about your personal info.</p>

        <p>By using X-Page, youâ€™re agreeing to these very simple</p>
        <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
        <br>
        <p>1. This website does not require any personal information, so if you somehow get them stolen you can't blame me.</p>
        <p>2. I'm not responsible if you get distracted and end up on a totally unrelated site. It doesn't matter if you happened to click a hidden link; any negative results are on you.</p>
        <p>3. These terms are subject to change at any moment, without notice. It is not my responsibility to update this page if that happens.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In conclusion: You're one of the few people who actually read this, and you're still using this site. That means you accept, and that's all I really wanted to know.</p>
